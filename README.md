# AUTOTUNE_GUIdevelopment
A Matlab GUI for dendritic and spine imaging analysis
AUTOTUNE implements essential methods to analyze functional imaging data of neuronal dendrites and spines, including but not limited to calcium imaging, voltage imaging, and glutamate imaging. It provides efficient algorithms for motion correction, feature extraction, and registering spines across multiple sessions. It is suitable for offline analysis of stimulus- and behavioral- -selectivity, spine plasticity, and active dendritic compartments. 

A detailed user guide is in the main repository.[AUTOTUNE User Guide.pdf](url)

## Quick start 
Follow these three steps to get started quickly, from installation to working through a demo. 

### Step 1: Install AUTOTUNE
If not already have Matlab installed, please install Matlab R2019a or higher, with following Matlab toolboxes Image Processing Toolbox, Curve Fitting Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, and Parallel Computing Toolbox. Download the GitHub repository of AUTOTUNE and put it in your local Matlab path. Call AUTOTUNE in Matlab command line. 

To achieve smooth data processing, operating systems equipped with sufficient Random Access Memory (RAM) and a multicore Central Processing Unit (CPU) are recommended. The software was developed and tested using 32 GB RAM and an Intel Core i7-5960X CPU with a clock speed of 3.0 GHz and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 graphics card. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) devices are strongly recommended though not required. 

### Step 2: Try out a demo 

## How to contribute
AUTOTUNE is an open-source project. Users from all over the world would help improve the work.
